# Jetson Nano Boot from USB Setup Guide

---

## Overview
This is guide is meant for the _Jetson Nano **A02**_ (additional info: [Nvidia Jetson Nano Developer Kit A02 vs B01 vs 2GB](https://tutorial.cytron.io/2020/10/14/nvidia-jetson-nano-developer-kit-a02-vs-b01-vs-2gb)) and assumes that the user has previously installed at least version **4.5.1** JetPack with the previously more common SD Card method (Link: [Getting Started with Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit)).  
The idea here is that the Jetson's operating system will be installed to a USB flash drive instead of a SD card.

## Download and Extract Image
The link for the SD card image that will be used with the flash drive can be found on NVIDIA's Developer Downloads section at https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-nano-sd-card-image.  
Please be aware that as of this writing the OS image file in the above link is for JetPack version **4.6.1** which is _not the latest_, therefore the user will have to manually upgrade via changing the APT source file.
